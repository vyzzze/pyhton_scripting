# Streaming Scripts Repository

This repository contains my collection of Python scripts and related files that I use for my live streaming setup. These scripts handle various tasks such as Twitch chat text-to-speech, OBS scene control, and Discord webhook integrations.

## Contents

- Twitch bot scripts  
- OBS websocket automation  
- Configuration files (with sensitive data excluded)  
- Utilities for managing stream overlays and alerts

## Important

- **Sensitive credentials and tokens are stored separately** in environment files (`.env`) which are **not included** in this repository for security reasons.  
- Make sure to create your own `.env` file with the necessary keys and tokens before running any scripts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template (if provided).  
3. Install required Python packages (e.g., `python-dotenv`).  
4. Run the scripts as needed during your stream.
