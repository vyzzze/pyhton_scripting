# streaming scripts repository

this repository contains my collection of python scripts and related files that i use for my live streaming setup. these scripts handle various tasks such as twitch chat text-to-speech, obs scene control, and discord webhook integrations.

## contents

- twitch bot scripts  
- obs websocket automation  
- configuration files (with sensitive data excluded)  
- utilities for managing stream overlays and alerts

## important

- **sensitive credentials and tokens are stored separately** in environment files (`.env`) which are **not included** in this repository for security reasons.  
- make sure to create your own `.env` file with the necessary keys and tokens before running any scripts.

## usage

1. clone the repository.  
2. create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template (if provided).  
3. install required python packages (e.g., `python-dotenv`).  
4. run the scripts as needed during your stream.
